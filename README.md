# Voting Processing Machine
A Deskop application I made in High school to process student election data. Program can read a voter database and file containing voting information and find the winners. Can also search and sort data and see how different searching and sorting algorithms compare against each other. 
You can directly download the .exe file above to test out the program. Download the Database and VoterInfo texfiles to try it out. Run as administrator upon downloading if the program does not start!
